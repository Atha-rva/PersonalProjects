	*	Concept of API Streaming 
	
		*	API streaming involves real-time communication between a server and a client, 
			enabling data to be pushed from the server to the client as soon as it becomes available.... 
			
	
	*	Real-Time Communication Protocols
	
	
		*	WebSocket: A full-duplex communication protocol that provides a persistent connection between the client and server, 
			allowing both to send data at any time.
		
		*	Server-Sent Events (SSE): A simple and efficient mechanism for the server to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection.
		
		
		>	Difference Between WebSocket and Server Sent Events.....
		
		
		*	Bidirectional vs Unidirectional 
		
			*	WebSocket: Provides a full-duplex communication channel, allowing both the server and the client to send messages independently at any time. 
				It enables bidirectional communication, making it suitable for more interactive applications.
				
			
			*	SSE: Is a unidirectional communication channel where the server can push data to the client. 
					 SSE is primarily designed for server-to-client communication.
					 
					 
		*	Connection Type 
		
			*	WebSocket: Establishes a persistent, long-lived connection between the client and the server. 
				This connection remains open until either the client or the server decides to close it.
				
			*	SSE: Uses a persistent HTTP connection. The connection is kept open, but unlike WebSocket, 
					it's a unidirectional connection initiated by the client.
					
		
		*	Protocol:

			*	WebSocket: Has its own protocol and operates over a separate, dedicated WebSocket protocol (ws:// for unencrypted, wss:// for encrypted connections).
			*	SSE: Utilizes standard HTTP protocol (over HTTP/HTTPS). SSE is a simple extension of the HTTP protocol, making it easier to implement and integrate into existing infrastructure.
			
		
		*	Browser Support 
		
			*	WebSocket:- Widely supported in modern browsers. Most browsers Provide native Web Socket Support.... 
			
			*	SSE :- Also well-supported in modern browsers but may not be widely supported as webSocket. SSE support is present 
			    in most browsers but it may require polyfills for older browsers... 
				
		*	Data Format:

			*	WebSocket: Supports bidirectional communication of binary data as well as text data. The payload can be more diverse.
			*	SSE: Primarily designed for sending text data (usually in the form of plain text or JSON). SSE is simpler and more lightweight for scenarios where text-based updates suffice.
			
			
		*	Use Cases:

			*	WebSocket: Ideal for applications requiring real-time bidirectional communication, such as online gaming, chat applications, or collaborative editing tools.
			*	SSE: Suited for scenarios where the server needs to push updates to the client, such as live feeds, notifications, or event streams.
			
			

*	Authentication and Authorization:

	*	Securing streaming connections with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized clients can access the streaming data.
	
	
*	Error Handling and Reconnection:

	*	Strategies for handling errors that may occur during streaming and implementing reconnection mechanisms to maintain a stable connection.
		
			

*	State Management in ReactJS or other Frontend Frameworks:

	*	Managing state on the client-side efficiently to handle incoming streaming data and update the user interface dynamically.
	
	
*	Server Push and Client Pull:

	*	Understanding the concepts of server push (where the server initiates communication) and client pull (where the client requests updates).

*	GraphQL Subscriptions:

	*	Leveraging GraphQL subscriptions to implement real-time data updates in a more structured and flexible manner.
	

*	Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

	*	Dealing with CORS restrictions when streaming data to a client hosted on a different domain.
	
	
	
*	GraphQL Subscriptions in API Streaming 



	*	GraphQL Subscriptions provide a mechanism for real-time data updates in GraphQL APIs. 
		While traditional GraphQL queries and mutations are designed for request-response interactions, 
		subscriptions enable a server to push data to clients in real-time when specific events occur. 
		This is particularly useful for applications that require live updates, such as messaging apps, live feeds, or collaborative editing tools. 
		
		
	*	Subscription Syntax:

		In GraphQL, a subscription is declared using the subscription keyword. It resembles a query or mutation but is designed to handle long-lived connections and receive updates.
		graphql
		
		
		subscription {
		  someEvent {
			eventData
		  }
		}
		
		
	*	WebSocket Protocol:

		GraphQL Subscriptions typically rely on WebSocket as the transport protocol. WebSocket provides a persistent, bidirectional communication channel that allows the server to push updates to subscribed clients efficiently.
		Connection Establishment:

		Clients establish a WebSocket connection to the server endpoint that supports GraphQL subscriptions. Once the connection is established, the server can send updates to the client whenever relevant events occur.
		
		
	*	Payload Structure:

		The payload structure of a subscription response resembles the structure of the subscribed event. It includes the data associated with the event.
		json


		{
		  "data": {
			"someEvent": {
			  "eventData": "Updated information"
			}
		  }
		}


	*	Subscription Lifecycle:

		*	Subscriptions have a lifecycle tied to the WebSocket connection. They begin when a client subscribes to an event and end when the connection is closed or the client unsubscribes.
		
			*	Handling Multiple Subscriptions:

				*	Clients can subscribe to multiple events simultaneously, and the server can send updates for all relevant events to the respective clients.
			
			
				*	Security Considerations:

				*	When implementing GraphQL Subscriptions, security measures, such as authentication and authorization, should be in place to ensure that only authorized clients can subscribe to specific events.
				
				
				*	Framework and Library Support:

				*	Popular GraphQL server implementations, like Apollo Server and GraphQL Yoga, support subscriptions. Similarly, client-side libraries, such as Apollo Client or Relay, provide support for handling GraphQL Subscriptions.
			
			
				*	Scalability:

				*	GraphQL Subscriptions need to be designed with scalability in mind, considering factors like load balancing, efficient event broadcasting, and horizontal scaling of the server.
			
				

		Note :- By incorporating GraphQL Subscriptions into a GraphQL API, developers can create real-time, reactive applications with minimal latency, 
				providing a more engaging and dynamic user experience.
