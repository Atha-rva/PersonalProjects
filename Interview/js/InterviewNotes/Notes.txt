# Javascript 

{
1. Variables 

    * It is name of a memory location. 
    * A variable is an identifer or a name which is used to refer a value. 
    * Can be writtern in combination of letters and numbers , _ , $ with the first letter being an alphabet. 


    Ex:- c , fact , b33 , total_amount 

    Limitations:- 

    * Must begin with an alphabet.
    * Must not contain any space characters. 
    * Javascript is a case sensitive languages. 
    * Can't use reserved keywords.  (Imp). 
}

2. Datatypes 

   * In Javascript we do not need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by 
     Javascript engine. (IMP).

   * We can use (var) data type. It can hold any type of data like String, Number, Boolean etc. 


  (Primitive Datatypes)     (Non Primitive Datatypes)

   * String                 * Object
   * Number                 * Array 
   * Boolean                * RegExp 
   * Undefined 
   * Null 
}

3. Declaring & Initializing a variable

  * Declaring a variable 

    * var roll;
    * var name;
    * var price;


  * Intializing a Variable 

  (Declaring &                              (Declaring & Initializing a variable on Same Line)                (var is optional)
  Initializing a variable on 
  different line)

  * var roll;                               * var roll = 101;                                                  roll = 101;
    roll = 101;                             * var name = "geeky shows";                                        name = "geeky shows";
                                            * var price = 125.36;                                              price = 125.36;
  * var name;                          
    name = 'Geeky Shows';

  * var price;
    price = 125.36;


  Note :- But To Identify We Should a var , let keyword before declaring and Initalizing a variable (Good Practice)
      
  *  Strings are written inside double or single qoutes... 

  *  Boolean value

    var ans = true;
    var result = false;


  * We can intialize a multiple variables in a single line also... 

  var a=20, b=10, c=30;
  var a="Atharva", b=20, c=50.25;


  * Redeclaring a variables.... 

  * If you re-declare a Javascript variable, it will not lose its value.... 

  ex :- 

  var name = "Atharva Deelip Deshmukh";
  var name;
  console.log(name);


  // Output :- Atharva Deelip Deshmukh



  * Note :- The Statements are executed , one by one, in the same order as they are written.... 
  * Javascript ignores multiple spaces... 
  * use line Break... 


  note :- 

  var wifi = "JIO";
  var wifi = "vodaphone";
  console.log(wifi);

  output :- vodaphone
  // the variable wifi replaces the old value with the new value 
}
